# Building Deep RL agents for text-based-games

- Implemented DRL algorithms (**SSAQN**, **DRRN**) to Text-Based Games with a Natural Language Action Space
- Applied NLP models (Bi-directional LSTM, Transformers) to embed and extract features from texts of state and action space

Python Packages used: **Pytorch, pyfiction, Keras, argparse, regex, numpy, collections, logging, random, selenium, pandas, matplotlib**
\
Other technologies involved: **Git, Latex, Windows/Linux, GPU, selenium**
